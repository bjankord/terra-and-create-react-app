## How to build a sample prototype app with terra-ui and create-react-app v1
---
# Terra UI is not compatible with CRA v1 out of the box
---
<Image src="./assets/sad.gif" />
---
## With a little custom config, we can get it work without ejecting
---
## First, let's run [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#quick-overview)

```
npx create-react-app terra-app
cd terra-app
```
---
## Then run `yarn start` and make sure everything is working after our initial install
Your app should load up and be available at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
---
## Ok, hopefull the app started correctly, now we're going to stop the app.
Press `Control + c`
---
## Now will open our new project in our code editor.
---
## We'll be using a project called [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) to supply custom webpack config
---
## Here we are going to swap react-scripts for react-app-rewired scripts
```
// old scripts
"start": "react-scripts start",
"build": "react-scripts build",
"test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom",
```

<br />

```
// new scripts
"start": "react-app-rewired start",
"build": "react-app-rewired build",
"test": "react-app-rewired test --env=jsdom",
```
---
## Next, we need to add some dev dependencies
You can view the dev dependency updates here: [https://goo.gl/gqvBLJ](https://goo.gl/gqvBLJ)
---
## Now we'll want to run `yarn` to install the new devDependencies we added to the package.json file
---
# Next, we need to create a `config-overrides.js` file in our root directory.
You can view the config-overrides here: [https://goo.gl/M88eh6](https://goo.gl/M88eh6)
---
## Now we need to update our `.gitignore` file so aggregated-translations don't get checked into version control
---
## Add the following to `.gitignore`
```
# generated translation files
/src/aggregated-translations
```
---
## Let's run `yarn start` and make sure everything is still working
Your app should load up and be available at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
---
## Ok, hopefull the app started correctly, now we're going to stop the app.
Press `Control + c`
---
## Similarly, we'll test and make sure the test script still works.
Run `yarn test`
---
You should see 1 Jest test pass. If you see issues with the Jest test not running,
it is likely an issue related to `watchman`.

You can run `brew install watchman`
---
If tests still don't work, you can check out the troubleshooting section of create-react-app testing.

---
## Now, we are going to add our first terra components to the app ðŸŽ‰
---
Run `yarn add terra-base`

then run `yarn add terra-button`
---
<Image src="./assets/yes.gif" />
---
## Next, we are going to import and use our button
---
Open `src/App.js` and the button import.
```
import Button from 'terra-button';
```
---
You can then use the terra button in your app like so:
```
<Button variant="emphasis" text="Hello Cerner" />
```
---
## Setting up terra-base
The [terra-base componet](https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/#/components/terra-base/base/base) is recommended to be used at the base of you React application.

It set's up [react-intl's](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl) `<IntlProvider />` component and manage's code-splitting translations files per locale.
---
Import `terra-base` in `src/App.js`
```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Base from 'terra-base';
import Button from 'terra-button';
```
---
Now in `src/App.js`, replace
```
<div className="App">
```
with

```
<Base className="App" locale="en">
```
---
Be sure to also update the closing
```
</div>
```
to
```
</Base>
```
---
## Now we can use components that provide their own translations for our [supported locales](https://github.com/cerner/terra-toolkit/blob/master/scripts/aggregate-translations/i18nSupportedLocales.js)
ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·
---
Run `yarn add terra-alert`
---
Import `terra-alert` in `src/App.js`
```
import Alert from 'terra-alert';
```
---
Now you can use the alert in `src/App.js`
```
<Alert type="success">Using terra + create-react-app</Alert>
```
---
Note that if you change the locale on `<Base />` to one of the other [supported locales](https://github.com/cerner/terra-toolkit/blob/master/scripts/aggregate-translations/i18nSupportedLocales.js), you'll see the word `Success` in the alert update for the new locale.
---
## Some additional minor tweaks
---
I'd recommend removing `src/index.css`. It's font-family overrides the terra font-family provided in terra-base.
The other styles in `src/index.css` are also provided in terra-base, so this file isn't really needed.
---
You'll also likely want to add the following CSS to your `App.css` file.

```css
#root {
  height: 100%;
}
```

This is a copy
of the steps we went through today. Feel free to just clone this repo to get started if you missed the steps in the demo.

## Some notes on usage
---
This project is provided as-is. Use it as wish. It can be great for building prototypes, getting familiar with terra, building reduced test-cases.
From here, you can create whatever you want!
---
## HealtheIntent and Orion have established patterns for builds React apps with Rails which should be used for building apps instead of using this.
---
## HealtheIntent Apps
* Check out the [HealtheIntent app-sdk](https://github.cerner.com/healtheintent/app-sdk) if you are building an app in HealtheIntent.
---
## Orion Apps and Engines
* Check out the [orion-app_starter](https://github.cerner.com/orion/orion-app_starter)
* Check out the [orion-generator](https://github.cerner.com/ion-server-core/ion-jenkins#generators)
